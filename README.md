# ðŸ¦Š Fennec

    Afraid of accidentally making your IP-Address public due to unsafe Docker Configurations?
    Fear not! Fennec is here to help you.

---
Configure Fennec to check Docker Containers for IP Leaks. Whenever Fennec detects a potential IP Leak, it will notify you.
You can even configure Fennec to automatically stop or kill the container in question.

Currently, you'll need to build the Docker Image yourself!
Fennec needs access to the Docker Socket to check the Containers for IP Leaks.

Use ``gradle dockerCreateDockerfile`` to create a Dockerfile

Use ``docker build build/docker -t fennec:latest`` to build the Docker Image
